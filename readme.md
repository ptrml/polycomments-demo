# Lazimg

Lazimg is a simple toy project leveraging Laravel 5, Redis and Socket.io for automated asynchorized image search. Not to be used for anything serious, this is just a patterns playground.

## Documentation

Will be provided when finished.

## TODO

-Slap together the frontend.

-Globally throttle the QPS per API so it wont break their terms of service.

-Async it up.

-Implement actual search APIs.
